<p>Well, I screwed up. I was only able to solve only one rev chall, their warmup. I guess itâ€™s normal for a n00b like me, though.</p>

<h2 id="the-large-cherries">The Large Cherries</h2>

<p>Weâ€™re given a file called Lao-Tzu.</p>

<p><img src="/images/poseidon/rev/1.png" alt="ptrace reeee" /></p>

<p>Thereâ€™s a ptrace at the very top, so if you bypass it, you will see that:</p>

<p>It asks for two kinds of inputs, and for the first time, it asks for 9 characters and 10 characters the second time.</p>

<p>The first input is sent to this function, called <code class="highlighter-rouge">magic_word</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/poseidon/rev/2.png" alt="magick" /></p>

<p>The function essentially makes sure that certain conditions are met for input[0] to input[7], even though the input asks for 9 characters. This is our key to solving this chall.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>from z3 import Solver, Xor, BitVec

a = [BitVec('a%s' % i,64 ) for i in range(9)]

s = Solver()
s.add(a[3] + a[0] == 0xab)
s.add(a[3] == 0x37)
s.add(a[2] ^ a[1] == 0x5d)
s.add(a[4] - a[2] == 5)
s.add(a[6] + a[4] == 0xa2)
s.add(a[5] == a[6])
s.add(a[6] == 0x30)
s.add(a[7] == 0x7a)
s.check()
m = s.model()
print(s.model())
b= []
for i in range(8):
    b.append(chr(int(m[a[i]].as_string())))
c = ''.join(b)
print(c)
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now, this piece of code gives out <code class="highlighter-rouge">t0m7r00z</code>, which is only 8 characters. This will be important later.</p>

<p>The second piece of input is a 10 character input, that checks if all of the characters add up to <code class="highlighter-rouge">0x294</code>, i.e. <code class="highlighter-rouge">660</code>. That happens to be the sum of digital sum of <code class="highlighter-rouge">t0m7r00z</code>.</p>

<p>Therefore, we need to add something extra to the mix. This character can be quite literally anything, and I just typed <code class="highlighter-rouge">t0m7r00za</code> as both inputs.</p>

<p>Flag: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Poseidon{Its_L3_t3Mp5_DeS_C3r1s35}</code></p>
